						<p id="titre2"> User Interviews </p>
						<p class="desc">I had the opportunity to interview computer science students and I could ask about their career goals, what was their opinion about having a portfolio in our field of study and what seemed to be fundamental. I also interviewed a young worker who started her own company a few years ago.<br/><br/>

						<p id="titre2"> Competitor Analysis </p>
						<p class="desc">The competitor analysis consist in reviewing other website that fulfill the same purpose as the one you are developing. I analysed a portfolio from someone in my homeschool, a portfolio from someone working in computer science and a portfolio from someone working specifically in the UX Design field. Thanks to this selection I managed to find pros and cons on each of them and brought a reflection on my own portfolio.<br/><br/>

						<p id="titre2"> Cognitive Walkthrough </p>
						<p class="desc">The cognitive walkthrough allows the developer to have a direct feedback from the user through different types of communication, verbal, facial expressions and gestures for instance. Those observations are essential to get a new point of view of the website. It is a tough exercise as you should not influence the user in his decisions and you should always be attentive to any information you could get from him.<br/><br/>

						<p id="titre2"> User Tests </p>
						<p class="desc">I conducted two tests, a question test and a click test. It was not easy to create these tests because this portfolio is quite simple with very few options and directions you can take. However, I wanted to make sure that they understood the purpose of the website and if they found that it was lacking some content or, on the contrary, had too much. With the click test I wanted to make sure that they would find a way to contact me, which is one of the main aspect of this website.<br/><br/>

				<a class="anchor">Summary of Findings</a>
				<div class="section group">
					<div class="col span_2_of_2">
						<p class="desc2">The user research and particularly the user testing part were not something new to me. I already had multiples opportunities to put them into practice before. However, I discovered some new tools like the "Feature Value Matrix" and the prioritization in the implementation of the features. Overall I am quite satisfied of my portfolio, it is clear, the navigation is done easily and most of the information about my work are available.<br/><br/>
						I would say that user research here was more useful than user testing. The simplicity of this kind of website does not require a big involvement in creating a whole serie of tests to be sure that every link is working fine. However, competitor analysis is fundamental as well as user interviews from people concerned aout the subject to get relevant comments. When it comes to testing, cognitive walkthroughs are a great alternative to user tests and user stories as it allows to  get a direct feedback of what could be wrong or misunderstood on the website.</p>

				<a class="anchor" >Incorporation of Findings</a>
				<div class="section group">
					<div class="col span_2_of_2">
						<p class="desc2">I indentified some issues that will be corrected in the future. The first page is quite empty and needs some improvements, I was also told that giving a definition of cognitics (in the French meaning, not well-known) could be useful. That is why I will certainly create an animation on the first page to explain the word cognitics with different other words and correct two problems at the same time.<br/><br/>
						The color and background of the second part of the homepage will be changed to become a bit more harmonious. And finally, details about my work experiences and projects will be added to give the user more information about my works and skills. These three improvements are the next steps I will work on to improve this portfolio that I may use in my professional life in the years to come if I managed to implement it the way I imagine it.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
